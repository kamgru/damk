# Thoughts on making onboarding suck less for newly hired developers

It doesn't matter how experienced the new developer on the team is - they will feel lost initially. A good onboarding process can make it easier, less painful and cut down the time from weeks to days. Here are my thoughts on how the process can be made better. All based on my personal experience so your mileage may vary.

## Have a glossary easily accessible

Both domain and technical glossaries should be easily accessible by team members. Especially when you're new to the project all the terms floating around will sound cryptic at best. I'm mentioning here two types of glossaries, because even though domain terms tend to be somewhat defined, dev teams usually have their own set of acronyms. 

It's very discouraging to get a task and not understand half of it due to unclear expressions. I'm talking about things like "SV3 should post a FX message to Scheduler when a user signs up for his AA". I'd like to be able to just pop the acronyms in a search box somewhere to get an explanation what 'SV3', 'FX message' and 'AA' are. 

## Have a designated 'first point of contact' person

During first weeks new devs will have many questions related to processes, code, permissions, etc. Knowing who to contact first instead of asking around, even if that person needs to point you to another to get your answer makes the whole thing more efficient. 

## Test environment setup instructions periodically

Developer's machine needs to be prepared to enable actual work. Code needs to be downloaded from repositories, dependencies and tools installed. Even if your team has a list of steps that need to be followed to setup the environment you should test it from time to time, preferably on a clean OS installation. Over time various services take on new dependencies, require new options or are deprecated. It may turn out that your list is no longer relevant.

## Make it easy to assign default permissions

Email, communication software, task board, code repositories all need credentials. Make sure you can easilly assign basic access for a new developer. I have lost so many hours because of a permission somewhere wasn't set and nobody knew where to find it or even who is responsible for managing it.

## Write down core processes

What is the lifecycle of a task? Do you groom it, who assigns the tasks? Is CI/CD implemented? If so how do you monitor it and what are the steps to take in case something fails. How does code review work in your team (you've got code reviews, righ? Right?) - does a dev need to notify someone to perform it? Review the processes periodically as nothing is set in stone.

## Think about your first days in a new environment

People who've been part of a team for an extended period of time tend to forget all the problems they had when they first joined. A bit of empathy goes a long way. Be supportive and understand that onboarding is a two way street, your team needs to adapt to the new hire as well.
