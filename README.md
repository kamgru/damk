This is a static site generator written in C#10/.NET 6. It powers my personal blog - [it-depends.dev](https://it-depends.dev).

This repository also contains all the content that is available on my blog.

Just like my blog this is clearly an alpha stage project, and just as my blog might be abandoned without any notice :)
